# Bash Battle Arena 🎮

Welcome to the **Bash Battle Arena**, a command-line game I've designed to help improve Bash scripting skills through a series of fun and interactive challenges. This repository contains my documented solutions for each level of the game, where the difficulty gradually increases as new Bash concepts are introduced.

The game is designed to be a journey towards becoming a **Bash Master**. Each level presents a problem to solve using Bash scripts, ranging from basic file manipulations to more complex system operations.

## Objective 🎯

The objective of the game is to complete various "missions" using Bash scripts. Each mission focuses on solving real-world problems using scripting techniques. The goal is to complete each level and learn new concepts along the way.

## Game Structure 🕹️

The game is structured into levels, with each level introducing new challenges. As you progress, the difficulty increases, and every 5th level introduces a **Boss Battle**, which combines everything you've learned from the previous levels.

There is no interactive interface (yet), so the game is currently played on your local machine. Your solutions are documented and shared through GitHub repositories.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured to include my solutions to each level. Each level has its own folder, containing the following files:

- **mission.md**: A detailed description of the mission for that level.
- **solution.sh**: The Bash script I wrote to solve the mission.
