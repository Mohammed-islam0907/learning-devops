# AWS notes

## IAM

- Account that has access full access 

##Â Groups & Users
- Create individual users so each user has access to what they need
- Users can be grouped e.g. based on roles
-

## Permissions

- Users/groups are assigned policies, which are JSON documents - which define the level off access they have
- Always apply the least privellage principle - don't give more permission than needed 

## IAM Policies Inheritence

- Inline policies are specific to users and not the group
- If a user is part of a group and needs more access that other members of the group, you can set inline policies

## IAM Policies Structure

## IAM - Password Policy

- In AWS, you can setup password policy:
- Set minimum password length
- Require specific characters
- Allow all IAM users to change their paaswords
- Prevent reusign passwords

## MFA

- Most effective way to secure account
- Even if someone manages to get your password, they will need another security method e.g. Google authenticator, Hardware Key Fob, etc.

## AWS CLI - Command Line Interface

- Allows you to interact with AWS services from the terminal 
- Can do what you do in the console
- Allows you to manage scripts - automating tasks

## SDK - Software Development Kit

- Makes it easy to connect code to AWS services
