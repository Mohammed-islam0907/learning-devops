# Docker notes

## What are containers?
- Containers are lightweight, portable units for running applications
- Contain code, runtime, and all dependencies the applications needsto run
- Isolated therefore runs the same on any environent - laptop or production environment


- Infastructure represents the physical/virtual hardware where everything runs
- Above we have the Host operating system - runs directly on the infastructure e.g. Mac OS
- Docker engine - what makes containerisation possible - provides environment to build, run and manage containers
- Above we have docker containers - each container holds application and all the independencies the application needs to run
    - containers are isolated meaning they don't interfere with eachother
