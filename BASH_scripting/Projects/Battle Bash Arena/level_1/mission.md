# Mission - Level 1: The Basics

## Objective

Create a directory named **Arena** and inside it, create three files: `warrior.txt`, `mage.txt`, and `archer.txt`. Once the files are created, list the contents of the **Arena** directory.

## Steps

1. Create a directory called `Arena`.
2. Inside the `Arena` directory, create the following files:
   - `warrior.txt`
   - `mage.txt`
   - `archer.txt`
3. List the contents of the `Arena` directory.

## Solution Explanation

This task focuses on basic Bash commands for directory and file manipulation. We'll:
- Use the `mkdir` command to create the `Arena` directory.
- Use the `touch` command to create the three text files.
- Use the `ls` command to list the contents of the `Arena` directory.

Please see the `solution.sh` file for the actual script.
