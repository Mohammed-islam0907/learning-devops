## Mission: Combine what you've learned! Write a script that:

1. Creates a directory names 'Battlefield'
2. Inside Battlefield, create files named knight.txt, sorcerer.txt, and rogue.txt.
3. Check if knight.txt exists; if it does, move it to a new directory called Archive.
4. List the contents of both Battlefield and Archive.
